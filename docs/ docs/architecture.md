Architecture Overview

This system is structured into three layers:

## 1. API Layer
Handles:
- Authentication
- Requests
- Error handling
- Response validation

## 2. Automation Layer
Contains flows such as:
- Welcome sequence
- Renewal reminders
- Upsell messaging
- Custom funnel routing

## 3. Analytics Layer
Provides:
- Subscriber metrics
- Message-response tracking
- Funnel conversion insight

This modular design allows each layer to evolve independently as Fanvue expands API functions.
