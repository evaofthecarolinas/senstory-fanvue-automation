# SENSTORY Fanvue Automation Toolkit

This repository outlines the architecture and planned implementation for an automation and analytics toolkit designed for Fanvue creators. 
The goal is to enhance the creator-fan experience ethically, securely, and professionally.

This project serves three purposes:
1. Demonstrate responsible preparation for Fanvue API key access.
2. Provide a framework for automating subscriber flows, content delivery, and analytics.
3. Build a scalable backend for the SENSTORY brand.

## Planned Modules

- **API Client** — interfaces with Fanvue’s API once access is granted.
- **Automation Flows** — welcome messages, renewal nudges, funnel logic.
- **Analytics** — behavioral insights and subscriber trends.
- **Utils** — logging, validation, error handling.

## Compliance

This project fully complies with the Fanvue API Access & Usage Policy:
- API keys stored in environment variables.
- No sensitive info stored in the repository.
- Respecting rate limits and scopes.
- No scraping or unauthorized access.

## Status
Awaiting API approval. This repo serves as architecture + intent documentation.
